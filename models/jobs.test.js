// Research results on Numeric vs Float
// seems to be related to how when float is being parsed, Node returns a string if it's too large?

// MODELS
// write tests!
// pattern match company model when creating job model
// the update method shouldnt' affect the id or company associated

// ROUTES
// write tests!
// pattern match company routes when creating job routes
// for initial go, don't worry about filtering yet
// add the security middleware similar to the company routes
// add filtering to job route after above tests pass; refactor from there

// COMPANY ROUTE
// write tests!
// update GET for a single company to also include the jobs associated with the company
